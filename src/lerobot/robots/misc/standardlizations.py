"""
This module is used to convert the state representation of all robotic arms 
into some kind of generic intermediate state, and the benefits are: 

1. The actions collected on different robotic arms can be trained in a unified representation.
2. The unified action representation predicted by the model can be translated into 
   a specific representation of different robotic arms.

This practice is especially suitable for scenarios that need to support multi-ontology and control forms.
According to Pika's data format, we set all distance units to 1m, angle units to 1 radian, 
and gripper opening and closing states to 1.6 and 0, respectively.
